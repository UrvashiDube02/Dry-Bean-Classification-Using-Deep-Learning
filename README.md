# Dry-Bean-Classfication-Using-Deep-Learning

**Abstract**

<p align = "justify">
The accurate classification of diverse dry bean varieties 
based on visual features and characteristics has been a 
significant challenge for classification algorithms in 
recent times. This research project aims to address this 
issue by proposing a highly accurate neural network 
system capable of classifying fourteen distinct dry bean 
varieties. Leveraging the power of deep learning 
techniques, including Feedforward Neural Networks, 
Convolutional Neural Networks, maximum and average 
pooling, batch normalization, and dense layers, we 
process a dataset comprising 33,000 images of the bean 
varieties in the introduced model. By meticulously 
tuning hyperparameters and incorporating multiple 
layers in our models, we achieve a remarkable 
maximum accuracy of 90.79%. Extensive model testing 
on the dataset and comprehensive performance 
evaluations are conducted to determine the optimal 
classifier, facilitating a detailed model comparison. The 
successful implementation of this system promises 
significant advancements in efficiently and precisely 
identifying bean varieties, thereby benefiting the 
agricultural industry through improved quality control, 
market segmentation, and informed decision-making 
for pest management and breeding endeavours.
